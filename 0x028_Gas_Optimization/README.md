# GasOptimizaitonResearch

Gas optimization is extremely important to minimize the cost of deployment and gas fees for the end user. 
This project demonstrates a series of testings to compare the gas fee among differet 


The hardhat gas reporter plugin is a great tool to estimate gas in development.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
